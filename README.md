# Conky ALERTS by WMO
 
A conky (with a script written in Python) that shows the weather alerts (world, country, region), using [WMO](https://wmo.int/) website.<br>
<br>
<br>

## **WIKI**<br>

Download the .zip file, extract the files, copy the file `.conkyrc_alertswmo` and the folder `.conky` inside your Linux `home`.<br>
If your `home` is named *pippo*, copy inside *pippo* so you get: `/home/pippo/.conky` and `/home/pippo/.conkyrc_alertswmo`<br>
You need to edit rows: 18-19-43-44-45 (and 21 optional) in `wmoalerts.py` file.
<br>
The python script saves data in files so you can build your conky alerts as you wish.<br>
The `.conkyrc_alerts` file i attach, works.<br>
Run the file `.conkyrc_alerts` from terminal (the first time you run this conky), so you can get possible errors.
